It can also show **estimated time** and **throughput**, and provides a \"top-like\" mode (monitoring).\n\n[![progress screenshot with cp and mv](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/14048573a12e356a41c84a7ba8001db708d2113e/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f5866656e6e65632f70726f67726573732f6d61737465722f636170747572652e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/14048573a12e356a41c84a7ba8001db708d2113e/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f5866656e6e65632f70726f67726573732f6d61737465722f636170747572652e706e67)\n\n_(After many requests: the colors in the shell come from [powerline-shell](https://github.com/milkbikis/powerline-shell).

You can:\n\n*   monitor all current and upcoming instances of coreutils commands in a simple window:\n\n    ```\n      watch progress -q\n\n    ```\n\n*   see how your download is progressing:\n\n    ```\n      watch progress -wc firefox\n\n    ```\n\n*   look at your Web server activity:\n\n    ```\n      progress -c httpd\n\n    ```\n\n*   launch and monitor any heavy command using `$!`:\n\n    ```\n      cp bigfile newfile & progress -mp $!\n\n    ```\n\nand much more.\n\n## [](https://github.com/Xfennec/progress#how-does-it-work)How does it work?\n\nIt simply scans `/proc` for interesting commands, and then looks at directories `fd` and `fdinfo` to find opened files and seek positions, and reports status for the largest file.\n\nIt's very light, and compatible with virtually any command.",[[1534397815521,["Administrator@Tielemao",[[-1,38," [![Build Status](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/87965cb4229b5ffa5de6ca0a9d2592e8d88dba4a/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f5866656e6e65632f70726f67726573732e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572)](https://travis-ci.org/Xfennec/progress)"]],[55,286],[38,38]]],[1534397824984,["Administrator@Tielemao",[[-1,43,"[](https://github.com/Xfennec/progress#what-is-it)"]],[43,93],[43,43]]]],null,"Administrator@Tielemao"]]}
